## Intro

The 30th of April, my grandparents handed me their car keys, right before boarding the plane to Greenland. It's a 2004 Audi A4, and it drives well. While I thoroughly enjoy driving it, and the freedom it brings, it doesn't give me blood on my tooth for ditching public transportation on my day to day commute.

## The car

The car is a 2004 Audi A4, which my grandpa bought lightly used. It's comfortable driving. I took my drivers license with manual transmission, as do most Danes, but have since gotten used to automatic, this Audi is stick shift, and I fear for the clutch of this vehicle.

I've driven it for a few days without having to even worry about the gas, and that's a big plus!

## Why I won't be getting a car myself

First off, it's important to note that cars are expensive, and I don't feel like prioritizing that kind of money over wacky apps and fun gadgets.

Another factor is the concentration. I have to keep staring at the road and be aware of my surroundings, which is fair, but it also means I can't bug [Hilli](https://www.inuk.blog/author/hillitech/), or keep up with my RSS feed, which is something I usually do in the train on my way to work.

I'm also put off by the inability to responsibly writing on [my post](https://www.inuk.blog/author/bastian/), or doing light stuff on [the CMS](https://ghost.org/).

In conclusion, I won't be getting a car, because I want to do other stuff but commuting, when commuting.
